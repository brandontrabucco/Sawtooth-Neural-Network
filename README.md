# Sawtooth-Neural-Network
This is a c++ implementation of a Sawtooth Neural Network--a network architecture that I developed while at Teuscher Lab at Portland State University. This archirtechure was designed to have the benefits of recurrent nets, without the large training time of RNN, and computational complexity of LSTM.
